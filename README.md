# BookLoanManager

An application made for my mother's school to manage the loan of book in her class.

## Goal

The goal was to make an easy to use, app with as much feature as I can to help my mother. Also it was my first real pytohn project.
As input, the application take two .csv file: one with the list of student and another with a detailled list of books available in the library.
Then you can add a nook by entrering the student name and the book's id. The student have a 2 weeks loan. In the app, the deadline is green when the student have more than a week left, it become orange when he have less than a week and it goes red when the deadline is over.

As an extra freature you can create a text file to have a summary with all names and books

# How to run

You just run the test.pyw file with tkinter installed and you can use the .csv files in this GitHub as an example
